# Experiments with MNIST

### 1. [MLP-GAN](./1-MLP-GAN/)
Simple Generative Adversarial Network implemented using Multi Layered Perceptrons and trained on the MNIST dataset. The model can be generated by running the notebooks in the [notebooks](./1-MLP-GAN/notebooks/) folder. To test the pre-trained model run the `test_model.py` script.
